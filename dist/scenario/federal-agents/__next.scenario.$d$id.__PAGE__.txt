Clearly say 'I wish to remain silent' and stick to it.","source":"5th Amendment - Protection Against Self-Incrimination","stateVariations":[]},{"title":"Right to Refuse Entry Without a Judicial Warrant","description":"Federal agents need a judicial warrant signed by a judge to enter your home or workplace.

An exception exists for exigent circumstances (imminent danger).","source":"4th Amendment - Protection Against Unreasonable Searches, Payton v.

If they say you're free to leave, calmly walk away. If they say you're being detained, you're not under arrest yet but they believe they have grounds to hold you. This is still a good time to ask for a lawyer and stop talking.","source":"4th Amendment - Seizure Doctrine","stateVariations":[]},{"title":"Right to Not Sign Documents","description":"Never sign anything a federal agent puts in front of you without understanding it completely and consulting a lawyer.
